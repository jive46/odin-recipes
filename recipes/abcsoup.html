    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>ABC soup is a nourishing soup cooked with potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, onions and pork ribs/bones or chicken. This nutritious ABC soup with many vitamins contained therein is baby/child-friendly. It could also be easily turned into a vegetarian soup by omitting the meat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For 4 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tomato</li>
        <li>1 Potato</li>
        <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>1 Carrot</li>
        <li>2 Chicken Drumsticks</li>
        <li>1/2 Corn/Maize</li>
        <li>2 1/2L Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Score the skin of the tomato and potato. Put them into a pot of boiling water. After one minute, put them into a bowl of cold water. This will "shock" them and the skin would then be easily removed. Otherwise, using a spoon would help too.</li><br>
        <li>Cut all vegetables into chunks or slices, according to your preference. Optionally, remove the skin of the drumstick.</li><br>
        <li>Put all ingredients into a pot of boiling water. Then, let it simmer at low heat for 2-3 hours or for a minimum of 1.5 hours. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
